/*
** bbi-sciatac-demux process profiles.
** Notes:
**   o  these profiles define process block-specific directives
**   o  the 'standard' profile is used by default. Alternate
**      profiles are selected on the command line, e.g.,
**
**        nextflow run -profile <my_profile> main.nf
**
**   o  the standard profile here defines directive values
**      that are used on the UW Genome Sciences computing
**      cluster.
**   o  there can be more than one configuration script, which
**      can complicate troubleshooting when the scripts behave
**      unexpectedly. The Nextflow documentation explains
**
**        When a pipeline script is launched Nextflow looks for
**        a file named nextflow.config in the current directory
**        and in the script base directory (if it is not the
**        same as the current directory). Finally it checks for
**        the file $HOME/.nextflow/config.
**
**        When more than one of the above files exist they are
**        merged, so that the settings in the first override
**        the same ones that may appear in the second one, and
**        so on.
**
**        The default config file search mechanism can be
**        extended proving an extra configuration file by using
**        the command line option -c <config file>.
**
**        It's worth noting that by doing this, the files
**        nextflow.config and $HOME/.nextflow/config are not
**        ignored and they are merged as explained above.
**
**        If you want to ignore any default configuration
**        files and use only the custom one use the command
**        line option -C <config file>.
**
**  o  selectors priority
**       When mixing generic process configuration and selectors
**       the following priority rules are applied (from lower
**       to higher):
**
**         1.  Process generic configuration.
**         2.  Process specific directive defined in the workflow
**             script.
**         3.  withLabel selector definition.
**         4.  withName selector definition.
**
**  o  a 'withName:' block defines directives used in the
**     process block with the same names.
**  o  at the BBI we use modules to access required programs
**     so we place module directives in the standard profile.
**  o  programs installed locally can be accessed by modifying
**     the PATH environment variable for the submitted jobs;
**     that is, by adding the directories in which the
**     programs can be found to PATH. Use the 'beforeScript'
**     directive for this purpose, for example
**
**       beforeScript = 'export PATH=/opt/python/bin:$PATH'
**  o  notice that the 'ext' allows one to define their own
**     process-specific variables that are accessible within
**     the process block. For example, in order to define
**     a variable called 'pass_in' for use in a process block
**     called 'do_this', add to this nextflow.config file
**     lines that look like
**
**
**  profiles {
**    my_profile {
**      process {
**
**        withName: do_this {
**          pass_in = 'Hello World'
**        }
**      }
**    }
**  }
**
** and in the main.nf script refer to pass_in within the
** do_this process block as
**
** process do_this {
**
** println( 'print this: ' + task.ext.pass_in )
** }
**
** The 'task' scope can be used to output directive values
** where one refers to the directive values as
**
**   task.memory
**   task.cpus
**   ...
**
** This can be helpful when troubleshooting.
